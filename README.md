# Student-Timetable-System
This project is a comprehensive desktop application designed to streamline and automate timetable management for university administration. It empowers administrators to effortlessly create, edit, and manage schedules for both students and faculty members.
The system offers robust and flexible viewing capabilities. Users can generate and display specific timetables based on various criteria, such as:
Academic Level: View the complete schedule for a specific level (e.g., Level 3 Computer Science).
Faculty Member: Display the full schedule for an individual professor. A key feature is the system's ability to consolidate a professor's schedule across multiple faculties, providing a single, unified view of their commitments.
Location: Instantly pull up the schedule for any specific room or hall (e.g., Hall 5).
A universal print function is available for any generated timetable, allowing for easy creation of hard copies for distribution and posting. The system is built to eliminate manual errors and provide a centralized, powerful platform for all scheduling needs.
